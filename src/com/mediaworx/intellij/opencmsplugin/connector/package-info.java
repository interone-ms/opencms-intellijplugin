/**
 * This package contains classes used to connect the IntelliJ plugin to OpenCms to execute actions like pulling meta
 * data or publishing resources.
 * The connection is done "the old way" using a JSP in OpenCms. There's a new Service provided by a servlet that right
 * now augments the old JSP connector, but sooner or later will fully replace it.

opencms-intellij-plugin
=======================

OpenCms plugin for IntelliJ providing IntelliJ menu actions to sync resources to and from the OpenCms VFS, to publish resources right from your IDE (using an additional OpenCms module), to create module manifest files and to package OpenCms modules into zips.

OpenCms menu actions are provided in four different locations:

* At the main menu
* In the project window (left)
* In the main editor window (center)
* In the file tabs (usually on top of the editor)

**Work in progress, not ready for public use yet.**

Documentation will follow some time in 2014.
